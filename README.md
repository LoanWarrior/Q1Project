# Q1Project Proposals

1. a site that lets you enter your location, and get shown all nearby options for parking on a map, using
   APIs for parking and maps.
   (not sure if this is out of scope or if an API for parking would do this)

2. a site that lets you enter two instagram names, and shows all sorts of connections they share. like people that follow both accounts, followed by both accounts, followed by one and following the other, etc.
uses instagram api.
